* tcalc.py

Tcalc is a command-line tool to perform mathematical operations on the rows and columns of delimited files.
For example, it can be used to compute the sum of the values in a column, or their average, or to find the
highest and lowest values. Tcalc can also filter rows based on arbitrary conditions, and create new columns 
whose values are computed from existing ones.
